# How to use  
Right now this script supports the following typing modes on MonkeyType:

* *Custom* - To let the script perform a typing test in the _custom_ mode, call the `given_word_count()` function at the bottom of the file and start the script. A new Chrome/Chromium window will now open. A new Chrome/Chromium window will now open. Use the starting delay to change the custom text and start the test.  
  
* *Words* - To let the script perform a typing test in the _words_ mode, call the `given_word_count()` function at the bottom of the file and start the script. A new Chrome/Chromium window will now open. A new Chrome/Chromium window will now open. Use the starting delay to switch to the Words mode of your desired length.  
  
* *Quote* - To let the script perform a typing test in the _quote_ mode, call the `given_word_count()` function at the bottom of the file and start the script. A new Chrome/Chromium window will now open. Use the starting delay to switch to the Quote mode of your desired length.  
  
* *Time* - To let the script perform a typing test in the _time_ mode, call the `given_duration()` function at the bottom of the file with the desired duration as the parameter and start the script. A new Chrome/Chromium window will now open. Use the starting delay to switch to the duration of your desired length.

There are a few options the user can use to modify the execution of the script:  

* Given typing speed. To increase or decrease the time between each typed character, the `get_given_pause()` function can be called at the bottom of the file, before calling either one of the typing functions. The time between each character is the same when using this function. 
* Sleep time before execution. When the either one of the typing functions is called, the program wil pause execution. This is done in order to allow the user time to open the desired typing mode on MonkeyType.
